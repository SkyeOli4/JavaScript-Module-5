<h1>READ ME</h1>
<h2>Popup/interaction </h2>
<p>I've added a pop-up and a interaction.<br> The pop up has a silly little comment when a button is pushed.<br>The interaction is also a button.It changes the colour of the body text when clicked.</p>
<h2>Action triggers </h2>
<p>There are Two Buttons, A "Click Me" and a "Click Me Too"Button. The click me button triggers the alert<br> and the click me too button triggers the colour change.</p>
<h2>Why that interaction</h2>
<p> I wanted my page to have some cheeky personality and I wanted to see if I could achove the colour change.</p>
<h2>Challenges and decisions?</h2>h2>
<p>Gettign all the Sytax exactly right and having to comb through and double check everythign that I've typed  was frustating and tiem consuming.</p>
